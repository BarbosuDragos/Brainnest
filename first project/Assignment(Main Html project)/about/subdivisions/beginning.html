            Google began in January 1996 as a research project 
            by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD 
            students at Stanford University in California.[20][21][22]
            The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder",
            Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of 
            the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left 
            before Google was officially founded as a company;[23][24] 
            Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the 
            company Willow Garage in 2006.[25][26]

            Google was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of 
            $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim,[20] co-founder of Sun Microsystems. 
            This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the 
            company to be able to use the funds.[39][40] Page and Brin initially 
            approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in 
            Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold 
            the company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. 
            David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co-founder 
            Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 AM at the front porch of 
            David's home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another 
            meeting at Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 AM. Andy 
            briefly tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and then went back 
            to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a 
            $250,000 investment.[41][42]

            After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to 
            early 1999,[43] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on 
            June 7, 1999,[49] with major investors including the venture capital 
            firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital.[40] Both firms were initially 
            reticent about investing jointly in Google, as each wanted to retain a 
            larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry and 
            Sergey however insisted in taking investments from both. Both venture 
            companies finally agreed to investing jointly $12.5 million each due to 
            their belief in Google's great potential and through mediation of earlier 
            angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture 
            companies.[50]
