            In March 1999, the company moved its offices to 
            Palo Alto, California,[51] which is home to several 
            prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups.[52] 
            The next year, Google began selling advertisements 
            associated with search keywords against Page and Brin's 
            initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search 
            engine.[53][22] To maintain an uncluttered page design, 
            advertisements were solely text-based.[54] In June 2000, 
            it was announced that Google would become the default search 
            engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites 
            at the time, replacing Inktomi.[55][56]
        </p>

            In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company 
            leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 
            Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California.[58] The 
            complex became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word 
            googolplex, the number one followed by a googol zeroes. Three 
            years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319 million.
            [59] By that time, the name "Google" had found its way into everyday 
            language, causing the verb "google" to be added to the Merriam-Webster 
            Collegiate Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, denoted as: 
            "to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet".
            [60][61] The first use of the verb on television appeared in an October 
            2002 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[62]

            Additionally, in 2001 Google's investors felt the need to have a strong 
            internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman 
            and CEO of Google.[46] Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins. 
            He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several 
            months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain 
            control over the company. Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point 
            even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia's $12.5m investment 
            if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer, 
            which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric wasn't 
            initially enthusiastic about joining Google either, as the company's full 
            potential hadn't yet been widely recognized at the time, and as he was occupied 
            with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric 
            agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment 
            and to provide funds Google needed.[63]
