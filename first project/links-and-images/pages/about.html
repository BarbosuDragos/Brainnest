            Initial D (Japanese: 頭文字イニシャル D, Hepburn: Inisharu Dī) is a 
            Japanese street racing manga series written and illustrated by Shuichi Shigeno. 
            It was serialized in Kodansha's seinen manga magazine Weekly Young Magazine from
            1995 to 2013, with the chapters collected into 48 tankōbon volumes. The story 
            focuses on the world of illegal Japanese street racing, where all the action is 
            concentrated in the mountain passes and rarely in cities or urban areas, and with
            the drifting racing style emphasized in particular. Professional race car driver
            and pioneer of drifting Keiichi Tsuchiya helped with editorial supervision. 
            The story is centered on the prefecture of Gunma, more specifically on several
            mountains in the Kantō region and in their surrounding cities and towns. 
            Although some of the names of the locations the characters race in have been
            fictionalized, all of the locations in the series are based on actual 
            locations in Japan.

        <h3>Plot</h3>
        <p>
            Takumi Fujiwara is a student working as a gas station attendant with his best 
            friend Itsuki. Itsuki is enthusiastically interested in being a street racer. 
            The team he feels closest to and hopes to join is the Akina Speed Stars, whose 
            team leader Koichiro Iketani is also working at the same pump station. Unbeknownst
            to his colleagues, Takumi helps out his father Bunta as a tofu delivery driver for 
            his father's store before sunrise each morning, passively building an impressive 
            amount of skill of over 5 years behind the wheel of the family car, an aging Toyota
            Sprinter Trueno (AE86). <br> <br>
            Shortly after the story begins, the Red Suns, a highly experienced racing team 
            from Mount Akagi led by Ryosuke Takahashi, challenge the local Speed Stars team 
            to a set of races on Mount Akina. Dispirited after watching the Red Suns' superior
            performance during a practice run, the Speed Stars expect to lose. Later that 
            night, the Red Suns' #2 driver, Keisuke Takahashi, heading home after the last 
            practice run, is defeated soundly by a mysterious Sprinter Trueno, despite 
            driving a much more powerful Mazda RX-7 (FD3S). An investigation into the 
            identity of the driver leads to Bunta Fujiwara, Takumi's father. While trying 
            to do his best for the team on Mount Akina, Iketani suffers a crash and damages
            his car and injures himself. He is unable to take part in the race to represent
            his team. Iketani begs Bunta to help the Speed Stars defeat the Red Suns, and
            he initially refuses, later relenting to "maybe" show up at the race. At the 
            same time, Takumi asks Bunta if he can borrow the car for a day to take a trip
            to the beach with a potential girlfriend (Natsuki Mogi), and Bunta seizes the 
            moment by granting permission (plus a full tank of fuel) on the condition 
            that Takumi defeats Keisuke. On the night of the race, the Trueno does not 
            show up, and the Speed Stars enlist a backup driver (Kenji) for the first run.
            At the last moment before the race starts, the AE86 arrives. Takumi steps out
            of the car to the bewilderment of the Speed Stars, who were expecting Bunta.
            He easily defeats Keisuke by utilizing a dangerous "gutter run" technique
            (putting both the left/right tires into the gutters to prevent centrifugal 
            force pushing the car outward) on the mountain road's hairpin corners.

        <h3>Manga</h3>
        <p>
            Written and illustrated by Shuichi Shigeno, Initial D was serialized for eighteen
            years by Kodansha in the seinen manga magazine Weekly Young Magazine from July 17,
            1995,[4][5] to July 29, 2013.[6][7] Kodansha collected its 719 individual 
            chapters in forty-eight tankōbon volumes, released from November 6, 1995,[8] to 
            November 6, 2013.[9] <br> <br>
            In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Tokyopop 
            (along with the anime series) in 2001.[10][11] The company changed the names of 
            the characters in the anime edition, and subsequently changed them in the manga 
            to match.[12][13] These name changes were to reflect the name changes that Sega 
            implemented into the Western releases of the Initial D Arcade Stage video games 
            due to name length limits.[12] Tokyopop also censored the brief scenes of nudity 
            from the original manga.[1] In addition, "street slang" was interlaced in 
            translations.[13] The company released thirty-three volumes from May 21, 2002,[14]
            to January 13, 2009,[15] before they announced in August 2009 that their manga 
            licensing contracts with Kodansha had expired.[16] In April 2019, ComiXology and 
            Kodansha Comics announced that they had released volumes 1 to 38 digitally, while
            volumes 39 to 48 were released in July of the same year.[17][18]
